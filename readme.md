# Flip my world

**Flip my world** is a challenging puzzle-platformer developed for the [GoedWare Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/goedware-game-jam-limited-color-palette). The core mechanic revolves around rotating the camera, which alters gravity and opens up new pathways. Players must master this mechanic to overcome obstacles and reach the goal in each level.

## Features
- **Gravity Switching**: Rotate the camera to change gravity and shift the level structure.
- **5 Challenging Levels + Tutorial**: Increasing difficulty with clever puzzles.
- **Stylized Art**: Designed with a limited color palette for the Game Jam.
